# LED-game-with-Arduino

An LED game programmed using the Arduino Uno microcontroller.

The game involves 5 LEDs (4 green and 1 red) that light up consecutively once switched on. The user must hit the push button when the red LED is lit. As and when he/she gets it right, the speed of the consecutive lighting increases thus increasing the difficulty of the game. There are about 9 levels in the game and when a user loses ,the score is displayed via the LEDs.
Arduino Uno microcontroller, LEDs , push button, jumper wires, resistors and a USB cable to connect the microcontroller are required to build the game. The code must be executed in the Arduino IDE.
